# Anti-burglary-System
This is basically a video survellience system with additional feature to notify the owner above the suspicious activities right on time.
Now this is a team project.
We will build an android app through which he will be able to get the CCTV video's highlights of the day, get instant notifications about any suspicious activity and to perform certain actions i.e. activate security systems , call police or lock down the door.
We will also install sensor around and in the secure area that will be attached to an arduino uno R3 with zigbee. This will send the sensor details to processor.Moreover, we will apply Image processing on the CCTV footage to detect human.
Sensors and the Image processing results will help us to double check if their is an intruder in the secure area and this will instantly send notifications on the user's app.
